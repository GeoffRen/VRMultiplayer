How to play: Enter the game by selecting an option on the Networking HUD. 

The point of this game is to shoot enemies (in our rough first submission enemies are red boxes) with your fellow teammates
to defeat the waves that are spawned in-game. You can move around using the arrow keys and shoot or melee if you are in range
of an enemy by pressing CTRL on the keyboard. You can also pick up health packs and restore your own health by looking at 
white boxes and pressing CTRL on the keyboard.

Up to 4 players can be supported at the same time.
